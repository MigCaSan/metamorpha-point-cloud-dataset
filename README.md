# **METAMORPHA Point Cloud Dataset and Preprocessing**

## **Overview**
This repository is part of the Horizon Europe Project **METAMORPHA**. It contains the preprocessing script used to process a dataset of 609 point clouds generated via **White Light Interferometry (WLI)**. The dataset also includes a parameter sheet (`data.xlsx`) that summarizes essential metrics derived from the point clouds for machine learning applications.

## **Contents**
- `preprocessing.py`: Python script used to preprocess point clouds and generate the parameter sheet.
- `./data/data.xlsx`: A structured Excel file with processed data metrics.
- `process_point_cloud.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook explaining step-by-step how preprocessing is applied to a single point cloud file.
- README: You're reading it! 😎

## **About the Dataset**
The point cloud dataset contains:
- **Format**: `.xyz` files
- **Number of Files**: 609
- **Description**: Each file represents a surface profile, with metrics derived from roughness calculations and step height analysis.

Due to the size of the dataset (~10 GB), it is not hosted directly on GitHub. You can access the point cloud files via the following link:

## **Preprocessing and Metrics**
The preprocessing script performs the following steps for each `.xyz` file:
1. **Correction of NaN Values**: Replaces missing data.
2. **Tilt Correction**: Aligns surfaces to eliminate measurement tilt.
3. **Filtering (λ < 10 µm)**: Smooths the surface for micro-roughness analysis.
4. **Metric Calculations**:
   - **Sa**: Arithmetic mean roughness.
   - **Sz**: Maximum peak-to-valley height.
   - **Sa λ<10 µm**: Filtered roughness for micro-scale.
   - **Average Step Height**: Difference between reference and processed regions.

The processed metrics are saved in `data.xlsx` for easy use in machine learning pipelines or further analysis.

## **Usage**
To run the preprocessing script:
1. Place the `.xyz` files in the `path/to/point/clouds` directory.
2. Define the output path for `data.xlsx` in the script.
3. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python preprocessing.py
   ```

## **Generated Output**
The preprocessing script generates an Excel file (`data.xlsx`) with the following columns:
| **Column Name**      | **Description**                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**             | Name of the `.xyz` file.                         |
| **Sa**               | Roughness (arithmetic mean).                     |
| **Sz**               | Peak-to-valley height.                           |
| **Sa λ<10 µm**       | Filtered roughness for micro-scale.              |
| **Average Step Height** | Step height between reference and processed regions. |

## **Notebook Explanation**
The repository also includes a Jupyter notebook (`notebook_example.ipynb`) that demonstrates, step-by-step, how preprocessing is applied to a single `.xyz` file. This is useful for understanding the methodology in detail.
